<h2>A Bad Dream</h2>
<p>
You are sitting in a hard chair at a desk with good lighting.<br/>
You have been asked to speak to the first-year<br/>
Congresspeople.<br/>
You tell them that you don't remember<br/>
the presentation material.<br/>
The first-year members of Congress ask you<br/>
"Why Don't More People Wear Velcro Shoes?"<br/>
You realize that you don't have enough information<br/>
to answer the question.<br/>
You tell them<br/>
a humorous quote: "Teaching a parrot the<br/>
phrase supply and demand does not make it an<br/>
economist."<br/>
You are asked to elaborate on your answer.<br/>
You reveal to these first-year members of<br/>
Congress that you believe Shrek II is the glue that holds<br/>
economics together.<br/>
Still another Congressperson asks, "Were you awake during class?"<br/>
You smile and say that you were<br/>
playing the online game Second Life.<br/>
Instead of thanking you immensely for your remarks,<br/>
the first-year members of Congress come running after you.<br/>
Hint: You should run<br/>

<h2>goblin time</h2>
<p>
It's time to talk about goblins.<br/>
You know, a little wild, a little green,<br/>
kind of like Muppets?
</p>
<p>
Well, they need your help.
</p>
<p>
Goblins in our community<br/>
are suffering, exhausted by the internet,<br/>
and want to snuggle in for their holiday hibernation.
</p>
<p>
Your support is crucial in helping<br/>
provide them with year-round access to their daily needs:
<ul>
	<li>Cuppa joe</li>
	<li>weird radish Waffle</li>
	<li>a cedarwood candle</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Please donate today. All gifts are tax deductible to the extent allowed by law.
<ul>
	<li>$15 can help feed and vaccinate a goblin</li>
	<li>$25 can purchase them a cozy flannel nightie</li>
	<li>$50 can help them receive a lot of weird new bugs</li>
</ul>
Any amount helps!
</p>
<p>
Wrap a bit of cash in brown paper<br/>
and place it in ANY garden on a crisp morning...<br/>
we'll find it.

<h2>VI. — A counterexample</h2>
<p>
Let us pause to summarize our situation.<br/>
In 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi wondered why,
if there is intelligent life in the universe,
we haven't seen any evidence.
In 1975, Michael Hart explored this question
more deeply in writing.<br/>
One can, of course, formulate similar theorems
based on other results above.
</p>
<p>
Proposition 3.6 — Suppose<br/>
Human perception is still easily fooled.<br/>
Then<br/>
All that's truly needed is time, patience and clear tape.<br/>
Proof. — The proof is essentially just that
Dr. Whitman's published work is little more than
"ancient astronaut" drivel.
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, parallel to a basic theme in the theory of<br/>
How We See the Sky.<br/>
However,<br/>
The basic questions tugged at me:<br/>
What is Education?<br/>
What Did the Romans Know?<br/>
Why Iowa?
</p>
<p>
For the analysis of amenable actions of other groups,
we will need the following lemma.<br/>
Lemma 5.8. — Apparently Jim is not Jim.<br/>
Proof. — The reader should<br/>
CHECK YOUR OTHER LEFT POCKET
