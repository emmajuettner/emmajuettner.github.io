<h2>The Logic of Individual Choice</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are a novice gardener.
</p>
<p>
The television reports<br/>
pictures of melting ice and flooded areas.<br/>
Warm weather arrives and<br/>
Southern California experiences unusually<br/>
high temperatures.<br/>
A small city located by a lake has been<br/>
dumping its raw sewage into the lake.
</p>
<p>
You<br/>
plant one seed in a flower pot and watch it grow.
</p>
<p>
Your friend says, "Why<br/>
are you wasting your time? You can't provide<br/>
the world's supply of wheat berries in your<br/>
little pot."
</p>
<p>
You cannot produce 100 tons of wheat per day.<br/>
However, you do produce<br/>
a stalk of wheat with plump wheat berries.
</p>
<p>
If the weather gets very hot, what will most<br/>
likely happen?<br/>
In the long run, what will happen?
</p>
<p>
The next year, you plant two seeds in that pot.

NaNoGenMo 2022 entry. A novel composed of dubious whale definitions, with apologies to Herman Melville.
]]>
</summary>
<content type="html">
<![CDATA[
<p>
If you are not familiar with <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">NaNoGenMo</a>: it is an annual challenge to write some code that generates a novel (at least 50,000 words) within the month of November. This was my first year participating! In fact, I nearly
did not participate this year either... I started this entry on a whim at 6:30pm on November 30th. ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
There were a lot of other cool entries this year, which I'd encourage you to check out! If you were drawn to this post by the Melville
mention, it may interest you to know that there were not one, but two other Moby Dick themed submissions! One of them takes the novel 
and <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/46">blacks out every repetition of a word</a>, and the other
<a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/34">colorizes words</a> in the book.
</p>
<p>
A few more of the other submissions that I thought were especially interesting, in no particular order: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/9">An Unfinished Novel of 50015 Words</a>, a self-referential
	novel that I found genuinely funny.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/28">A Letter Groove</a>, a program that "cuts out" words
	in scanned book pages to reveal what's beneath (some of the output is really quite beautiful).</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/35">There Are Stars</a>, an interactive story where starring the Github
	repository causes a new character to be added to the story. Technically not a complete entry because it didn't reach 50,000
	words by the end of November, but I think it's one of the most impressive and creative ones I've seen.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/42">Broken Computer Games</a>, a compilation book of BASIC programs
	that are composed of mashed-up lines from the book Basic Computer Games by Dave Ahl.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The premise of my submission: In Moby Dick, Ishmael defines a whale as "a spouting fish with a horizontal tail."
My generated novel consists of a series of other dubiously accurate whale definitions in the same format, constructed using a
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/tracery-grammar.json">tracery grammar</a>.
To put together a grammar that had enough word variety to make the output interesting, I pulled from a
<a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/humans/descriptions.json">list of adjectives</a> from Darius Kazemi's corpora repo, as well as many of the "words used to describe" lists published by Macmillan Dictionary.
The below excerpt is the beginning of the example output I generated; you can read the
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/output.txt">full output</a>
as well, if you're really that interested in whale definitions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>An Expanded Meditation</h2>
<p>'Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.'
- Herman Melville, Moby Dick, Ch. 32, Cetology.</p>
<p>A whale is a natural animal with a graceful head.<br/>
A whale is a cooperative giant with an adorable tail.<br/>
A whale is an inexperienced giant with a geometric heart.<br/>
A whale is an apprehensive beast with a striped forehead.<br/>
A whale is an artificial ungulate with a non-flexible back.<br/>
A whale is a grave mammal with a peaked jaw.<br/>
A whale is a shrewd mammal with an impermeable belly.<br/>
A whale is a ridiculous creature with a chiseled fin.<br/>
A whale is an orderly creature with an elongated belly.<br/>
A whale is an excitable creature with a graceful hump.<br/>
A whale is an artistic fish with a lined set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a caustic leviathan with a mottled stomach.<br/>
A whale is a sad beast with an enlarged jaw.<br/>
A whale is a suspicious fellow with a concave set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a supercilious mammal with a corrugated hump.<br/>
A whale is a drunk animal with a clean rib cage.<br/>
A whale is a prejudiced animal with a well-rounded set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a reclusive creature with an eye-catching jaw.<br/>
A whale is a willing ungulate with an impermeable fin.<br/>
A whale is a cynical animal with an arched forehead.</p>

<h2>A Bad Dream</h2>
<p>
You are sitting in a hard chair at a desk with good lighting.<br/>
You have been asked to speak to the first-year<br/>
Congresspeople.<br/>
You tell them that you don't remember<br/>
the presentation material.<br/>
The first-year members of Congress ask you<br/>
"Why Don't More People Wear Velcro Shoes?"<br/>
You realize that you don't have enough information<br/>
to answer the question.<br/>
You tell them<br/>
a humorous quote: "Teaching a parrot the<br/>
phrase supply and demand does not make it an<br/>
economist."<br/>
You are asked to elaborate on your answer.<br/>
You reveal to these first-year members of<br/>
Congress that you believe Shrek II is the glue that holds<br/>
economics together.<br/>
Still another Congressperson asks, "Were you awake during class?"<br/>
You smile and say that you were<br/>
playing the online game Second Life.<br/>
Instead of thanking you immensely for your remarks,<br/>
the first-year members of Congress come running after you.<br/>
Hint: You should run<br/>

<h2>VI. â€” A counterexample</h2>
<p>
Let us pause to summarize our situation.<br/>
In 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi wondered why,
if there is intelligent life in the universe,
we haven't seen any evidence.
In 1975, Michael Hart explored this question
more deeply in writing.<br/>
One can, of course, formulate similar theorems
based on other results above.
</p>
<p>
Proposition 3.6 â€” Suppose<br/>
Human perception is still easily fooled.<br/>
Then<br/>
All that's truly needed is time, patience and clear tape.<br/>
Proof. â€” The proof is essentially just that
Dr. Whitman's published work is little more than
"ancient astronaut" drivel.
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, parallel to a basic theme in the theory of<br/>
How We See the Sky.<br/>
However,<br/>
The basic questions tugged at me:<br/>
What is Education?<br/>
What Did the Romans Know?<br/>
Why Iowa?
</p>
<p>
For the analysis of amenable actions of other groups,
we will need the following lemma.<br/>
Lemma 5.8. â€” Apparently Jim is not Jim.<br/>
Proof. â€” The reader should<br/>
CHECK YOUR OTHER LEFT POCKET
