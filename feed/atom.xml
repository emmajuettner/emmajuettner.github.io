Stripping the styles off of my website in celebration of semantic markup.

<p>
If you're reading this on April 9th directly on my website (rather than via RSS),
this post should be displayed without styles, because it's 
<a href="https://css-naked-day.github.io/">CSS Naked Day</a>! Well, actually, if you have dark mode
enabled or if you've previously selected a theme on my site, you might be seeing those
styles instead (I didn't want to mess with styles if someone had already expressed
a preference, since it might be unpleasant to be expecting dark mode
and get hit with the bright white default background). 
But otherwise, you should be seeing the bare HTML.
</p>
<p>
I've also added a permanent "plain html mode" button
to the theme picker at the top of my website. I think it's useful to have the option
of seeing my website without markup anytime because it better reflects how some people will
interact with the content (via RSS reader, screen reader, etc.) and it gives people
options for how they want to interact with my site (maybe they use dark mode generally,
but want to try the plain html just to see what the plain markup looks like).
The theme picker does rely on Javascript; I'm not entirely happy with this,
since some people can't or won't use JS, but I don't know
of another way to allow selection of multiple themes (not just light/dark) on
a static site. If you do know of a way to do this, though, let me know!

NaNoGenMo 2023 entry. A procedural mystery based on the board game Clue.
]]>
</summary>
<content type="html">
<![CDATA[
<p>
If you are familiar with <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">NaNoGenMo</a>, you may be thinking:
"Wasn't the last one of those in November? And isn't it April now (at time of posting)?"
You would be right, but I never got around to posting about my entry when I first finished it,
so better late than never! If you're not familiar with NaNoGenMo, it is an annual challenge 
to write some code that generates a novel (defined as at least 50,000 words) within the month of November. 
This was my second year participating; my previous attempt was 
<a href="https://emmajuettner.com/posts/an-expanded-meditation/">An Expanded Meditation</a>.
</p>
<p>
Before I talk about my entry, though, I want to point out a few of the other 2023 entries that I thought
were particularly interesting or impressive: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2023/issues/32">Whalequest</a>, a reordering of Moby Dick
	where the least whaley sentences come first and the whaliest sentences are at the end.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2023/issues/3">Il nome della zebra</a>, a novel inspired
	by The Name of the Rose and structured using a logic puzzle.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2023/issues/28">The Library of Sir Herbert Quain</a>,
	a collection of intriguing pamphlets and publications.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2023/issues/27">The Bottish Play</a>, a rendition of Macbeth
	performed entirely by various text-to-speech software. This one might be my favorite, it is truly
	eerie to hear The TikTok Voice playing the role of a witch in Macbeth.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
My entry for NaNoGenMo 2023, <a href="http://emmajuettner.com/the-forgotten-clue/">The Forgotten Clue</a>,
 was inspired by the board game Clue (or Cluedo).
I wrote some code that approximates the mechanics of Clue (characters take turns
moving from room to room, and accusing one another of the murder).
The variation in language comes from a Tracery grammar which draws heavily on phrases
from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/48441/48441-h/48441-h.htm">Putnam's Phrase Book</a>,
a 1919 book which compiles "Over 100 Model Social Letters and 6000 of the World’s Best English Phrases".
It is a fascinating resource, and if you are interested in generative writing,
I recommend checking it out as I bet you could do a lot of other really neat stuff with it.
</p>
<p>
The output of my code is a series of scenes that each read something like this:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With remarkable equanimity, Mr Green stepped into the billiard room.</p>
<p>The room was empty.</p>
<p>Mr Green called Miss Scarlett into the billiard room.</p>
<p>Mr Green said, "Miss Scarlett, the results are everywhere apparent: 
it was Mrs White in the billiard room with the wrench!"</p>
<p>Irritably self-conscious, Miss Scarlett answered, "You are certainly not making 
a reputation for accuracy by some of your statements. Obviously the murder weapon isn't the wrench. 
The cause of death was not a blunt object."</p>
<p>"Oh," Mr Green said. "Owing to a foolish error, I was mistaken."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I had one serious challenge in meeting the 50,000 word count: I couldn't get anywhere near 50,000 words 
if the detectives played the game skillfully. If they actually made sensible choices about what to suggest, 
using what they had already learned about which possibilities had been eliminated,
the novel couldn't get much past 10,000 words before someone would figure out the solution. 
So as a cheap trick to meet the word count, I gave each detective an 80% chance of forgetting 
each clue the moment they hear it. Hence the title, "The Forgotten Clue." Despite this handicap,
one detective does eventually manage to recall enough clues to solve the mystery,
fortunately after the 50,000 word count has been safely met. 
I won't spoil the ending for you here, though!

A digital collage poem project, composed from random Wikipedia pages.
]]>
</summary>
<content type="html">
<![CDATA[
<p>You know that Wikipedia link that takes you to a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">random Wikipedia page</a>? 
I've always found that really neat. It kind of replicates the feeling of 
flipping through a book to see what weird or interesting things you’ll find on 
whichever page you stop at (this works especially well with thick books like 
encyclopedias, dictionaries, or Bibles). A book as a physical object inherently 
has that affordance, but digital media often doesn’t unless someone takes the 
time to build it in. So I always appreciate when people put in that effort to make 
it easier to digitally stumble across cool things that you might otherwise have 
never known existed.</p>

<p>I also enjoy making collage poems out of material that is not typically seen
 as having intrinsic artistic merit (see also: composing poetry from junk mail 
 or econ test questions). So it occurred to me that random Wikipedia pages might 
 make for a really interesting source of collage material.</p>

<p>Since large language model (LLM) tools have been such a constant topic of 
conversation lately, I’ve also been thinking a lot about collage poetry in 
juxtaposition to LLM-generated text. One of the primary (and, in my opinion, 
accurate) criticisms of LLMs is that they vacuum up other people’s words without 
permission, stick them in a computational blender, and claim the output as an 
original creative work; and that one or more aspects of this process is unethical. 
At a glance, collage poetry, whether analog or digital, has some similarities 
to LLM text generation! When I compose a poem, I am taking other people’s words 
(often without asking permission) and mixing them up into something that I would 
consider to be a “new” creative work. Because of these seeming similarities, 
I have been thinking a lot lately about what responsibilities artists have when 
making art that is very directly derived from others’ work.</p>

<p>Without going too far off on this tangent-- one principle that I think is 
important is citation of the original source material. Any collage art is sort of 
intrinsically in conversation with the original work from which it was composed, 
and I think it’s valuable to explicitly name the source material so that anyone 
looking at the derivative work can better understand that conversation. You’re 
missing out on so much context if you only see the collage in isolation. This is why, 
in my Wikipedia collage poems, I have included citation footnotes which link to 
the pages where I originally found each phrase. It’s partly just continuing a 
visual gimmick (the poems are formatted and styled to look like Wikipedia pages), 
but it’s also just a straightforward way to credit the original material. 
And maybe it will make some people curious to explore the cited pages 
(like, does Martha Stewart’s Wikipedia page really contain the word “Gnomes”? 
The answer is yes!).</p>

<p>I have finished a few poems now so I consider it finished-enough to be posted here,
 though I intend to keep making some more poems as I have time. I'm calling the 
 project <a href="https://emmajuettner.com/found-wikipoetry/">Found Wikipoetry</a> 
 (mainly because the names "Wikipoetry" or "Wikipoem" 
 seem to have already been taken). You can read the poems, and some more 
 information about how they were created, at the above link.</p>

<h2>The Logic of Individual Choice</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are a novice gardener.
</p>
<p>
The television reports<br/>
pictures of melting ice and flooded areas.<br/>
Warm weather arrives and<br/>
Southern California experiences unusually<br/>
high temperatures.<br/>
A small city located by a lake has been<br/>
dumping its raw sewage into the lake.
</p>
<p>
You<br/>
plant one seed in a flower pot and watch it grow.
</p>
<p>
Your friend says, "Why<br/>
are you wasting your time? You can't provide<br/>
the world's supply of wheat berries in your<br/>
little pot."
</p>
<p>
You cannot produce 100 tons of wheat per day.<br/>
However, you do produce<br/>
a stalk of wheat with plump wheat berries.
</p>
<p>
If the weather gets very hot, what will most<br/>
likely happen?<br/>
In the long run, what will happen?
</p>
<p>
The next year, you plant two seeds in that pot.

NaNoGenMo 2022 entry. A novel composed of dubious whale definitions, with apologies to Herman Melville.
]]>
</summary>
<content type="html">
<![CDATA[
<p>
If you are not familiar with <a href="https://nanogenmo.github.io/">NaNoGenMo</a>: it is an annual challenge to write some code that generates a novel (at least 50,000 words) within the month of November. This was my first year participating! In fact, I nearly
did not participate this year either... I started this entry on a whim at 6:30pm on November 30th. 😊
</p>
<p>
There were a lot of other cool entries this year, which I'd encourage you to check out! If you were drawn to this post by the Melville
mention, it may interest you to know that there were not one, but two other Moby Dick themed submissions! One of them takes the novel 
and <a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/46">blacks out every repetition of a word</a>, and the other
<a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/34">colorizes words</a> in the book.
</p>
<p>
A few more of the other submissions that I thought were especially interesting, in no particular order: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/9">An Unfinished Novel of 50015 Words</a>, a self-referential
	novel that I found genuinely funny.</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/28">A Letter Groove</a>, a program that "cuts out" words
	in scanned book pages to reveal what's beneath (some of the output is really quite beautiful).</li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/35">There Are Stars</a>, an interactive story where starring the Github
	repository causes a new character to be added to the story. Technically not a complete entry because it didn't reach 50,000
	words by the end of November, but I think it's one of the most impressive and creative ones I've seen.
	<li><a href="https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/2022/issues/42">Broken Computer Games</a>, a compilation book of BASIC programs
	that are composed of mashed-up lines from the book Basic Computer Games by Dave Ahl.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The premise of my submission: In Moby Dick, Ishmael defines a whale as "a spouting fish with a horizontal tail."
My generated novel consists of a series of other dubiously accurate whale definitions in the same format, constructed using a
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/tracery-grammar.json">tracery grammar</a>.
To put together a grammar that had enough word variety to make the output interesting, I pulled from a
<a href="https://github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/humans/descriptions.json">list of adjectives</a> from Darius Kazemi's corpora repo, as well as many of the "words used to describe" lists published by Macmillan Dictionary.
The below excerpt is the beginning of the example output I generated; you can read the
<a href="https://github.com/emmajuettner/an-expanded-meditation/blob/main/output.txt">full output</a>
as well, if you're really that interested in whale definitions.
</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>An Expanded Meditation</h2>
<p>'Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded meditation.'
- Herman Melville, Moby Dick, Ch. 32, Cetology.</p>
<p>A whale is a natural animal with a graceful head.<br/>
A whale is a cooperative giant with an adorable tail.<br/>
A whale is an inexperienced giant with a geometric heart.<br/>
A whale is an apprehensive beast with a striped forehead.<br/>
A whale is an artificial ungulate with a non-flexible back.<br/>
A whale is a grave mammal with a peaked jaw.<br/>
A whale is a shrewd mammal with an impermeable belly.<br/>
A whale is a ridiculous creature with a chiseled fin.<br/>
A whale is an orderly creature with an elongated belly.<br/>
A whale is an excitable creature with a graceful hump.<br/>
A whale is an artistic fish with a lined set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a caustic leviathan with a mottled stomach.<br/>
A whale is a sad beast with an enlarged jaw.<br/>
A whale is a suspicious fellow with a concave set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a supercilious mammal with a corrugated hump.<br/>
A whale is a drunk animal with a clean rib cage.<br/>
A whale is a prejudiced animal with a well-rounded set of lungs.<br/>
A whale is a reclusive creature with an eye-catching jaw.<br/>
A whale is a willing ungulate with an impermeable fin.<br/>
A whale is a cynical animal with an arched forehead.</p>

<h2>A Bad Dream</h2>
<p>
You are sitting in a hard chair at a desk with good lighting.<br/>
You have been asked to speak to the first-year<br/>
Congresspeople.<br/>
You tell them that you don't remember<br/>
the presentation material.<br/>
The first-year members of Congress ask you<br/>
"Why Don't More People Wear Velcro Shoes?"<br/>
You realize that you don't have enough information<br/>
to answer the question.<br/>
You tell them<br/>
a humorous quote: "Teaching a parrot the<br/>
phrase supply and demand does not make it an<br/>
economist."<br/>
You are asked to elaborate on your answer.<br/>
You reveal to these first-year members of<br/>
Congress that you believe Shrek II is the glue that holds<br/>
economics together.<br/>
Still another Congressperson asks, "Were you awake during class?"<br/>
You smile and say that you were<br/>
playing the online game Second Life.<br/>
Instead of thanking you immensely for your remarks,<br/>
the first-year members of Congress come running after you.<br/>
Hint: You should run<br/>

<h2>VI. — A counterexample</h2>
<p>
Let us pause to summarize our situation.<br/>
In 1950, physicist Enrico Fermi wondered why,
if there is intelligent life in the universe,
we haven't seen any evidence.
In 1975, Michael Hart explored this question
more deeply in writing.<br/>
One can, of course, formulate similar theorems
based on other results above.
</p>
<p>
Proposition 3.6 — Suppose<br/>
Human perception is still easily fooled.<br/>
Then<br/>
All that's truly needed is time, patience and clear tape.<br/>
Proof. — The proof is essentially just that
Dr. Whitman's published work is little more than
"ancient astronaut" drivel.
</p>
<p>
This is, of course, parallel to a basic theme in the theory of<br/>
How We See the Sky.<br/>
However,<br/>
The basic questions tugged at me:<br/>
What is Education?<br/>
What Did the Romans Know?<br/>
Why Iowa?
</p>
<p>
For the analysis of amenable actions of other groups,
we will need the following lemma.<br/>
Lemma 5.8. — Apparently Jim is not Jim.<br/>
Proof. — The reader should<br/>
CHECK YOUR OTHER LEFT POCKET
