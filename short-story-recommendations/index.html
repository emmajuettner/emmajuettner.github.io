<!-- title: Short Story Recommendations -->
<h1>Short Story Recommendations</h1>
<p>I like short stories, and I like making lists of things.
Lately I've started keeping this (non-comprehensive) list of short stories that I have enjoyed.
The majority are sci-fi, since that's what I read most of.
Latest additions go at the top of the list.
You can also subscribe to this list via an

<li>
	<a href="https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/exhalation/">Exhalation</a> by Ted Chiang. Actually this is a recommendation not just for the story "Exhalation" but for the entire collection of short stories by the same name. It's a really thought-provoking and cohesive collection that approaches our concepts of time and consciousness and choice from a variety of angles. But "Exhalation" the story is also available to read online if you are in the mood for an unusual sort of apocalypse. 6552 words.
