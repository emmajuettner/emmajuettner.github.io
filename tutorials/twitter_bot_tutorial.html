		<h2>Twitter Bot Tutorial</h2>
		<p>No coding experience required!</br>
		</br>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		Today we'll be making Twitter bots! </br>
		Bots on Twitter range from being very simple to very complex, 
		but this tutorial will teach you just the basics you need to get
		a bot up and running in an hour or so. 
		Once you understand the basics, I encourage you to look up some 
		more advanced tutorials to see what's possible. Here are just a few 
		examples of things you can do with Twitter bots, to give you ideas 
		(some of these are very simple, others are very advanced!):</br>

		<h4>Tools</h4>
		<a href="http://tracery.io/editor">official Tracery editor</a></br>
		<a href="http://atduskgreg.github.io/bother/tracery.html">alternate Tracery editor (more beginner-friendly)</a></br>
		<a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com">Cheap Bots Done Quick (CBDQ)</a></br>
		You don't have to install anything for this tutorial, 
		it can all be done online!</br>
		</br>
		<h4>Overview</h4>
		Tracery is a tool built to do basic text generation, MadLibs-style, 
		from a list of lists that you create. (If you're familiar with JSON, 
		that's what this is, but you don't need to know what JSON is to use 
		Tracery.) When you upload your Tracery 
		code to Cheap Bots Done Quick and connect a Twitter account, 
		tweets will be generated and posted according to the variables and 
		lists you create in Tracery and the schedule you set in CBDQ. 
		You can make your lists as simple or as complex as you like.</br>
		</br>
		The <a href="https://tracery.io/editor">online Tracery editor</a> has a helpful 
		visualization tool for keeping track of the parts of your list 
		and how they work together, so I recommend writing your code there 
		rather than in another text editor. Or, you can use the alternate editor
		linked above-- it has an interface that's easier to understand for beginners.</br>
		</br>
		<h4>Tutorial</h4>
		STEP ONE: Coding with Tracery</br>
		Start by coming up with a sentence structure that can be varied 
		with different words (think MadLibs!) and then identify the 
		different word types you'll need to construct that sentence 
		(for this tutorial example, I'll make a basic D&D character 
		generator: "My character [name] is a [level] level [class]." 
		So an example sentence might be "My character Mardred is a 5th level
		bard.") You'll also need to come up with a list of words that 
		fit each category that you create. (for example, the "class" 
		category in my example might include "cleric", "fighter", "bard", 
		"wizard", etc.)</br>
		</br>
		In Tracery, you put the name of the list in quotation marks, 
		followed by a colon, and then put the list items in a set of 
		brackets, with each item within quotation marks. When you want 
		to randomly pick an item from another list, use this notation: 
		#list_name#. Each list should be on a separate line, and should 
		be followed by a comma (except the last one). The first list is 
		your main structure, and it should be named "origin". See the 
		example code below to see this structure in action.</br>
		</br>
		Example code:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		{
		"origin":["My character #name# is a #level# level #class#."],</br>
		"name":["Lucretia","Roswell","Davenport","Johann","Sloane","Hurley","Barry"],</br>
		"level":["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th","8th","9th","10th"],</br>
		"class":["cleric","fighter","wizard","rogue","bard","druid","paladin"]</br>
		}
		</div></br>
		</br>
		Example output:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		My character Davenport is a 2nd level rogue.
		</div></br>
		</br>
		Important Note: Tracery is very picky about commas and new lines. 
		If the output isn't showing up in the editor, go through and 
		triple check that you have a comma after every list except the 
		last one, and that each list is on a new line. It's best to write 
		your code in the <a href="https://tracery.io/editor">online Tracery editor</a> 
		for this reason, so that you can catch those kinds of errors as you go.
		You may also have issues copying and pasting my code directly from
		this website (I think there's a weird issue with the line breaks breaking the Tracery parser);
		you'll probably have better luck if you just use my code
		as a model, and type your own code out in the editor yourself.</br>
		</br>
		Another Note: Technically, this is all you need to make a 
		functioning bot, so if you're short on time and just want a basic 
		bot, you can skip to Step Five at this point. Otherwise, stick 
		around for some techniques that will make your bot a little more 
		sophisticated.</br>
		</br>
		STEP TWO: Saving Variables</br>
		If you want to use a particular word type twice in your tweet, 
		and you want both instances of it to match up (i.e. if your 
		character's name is randomly picked as "Lucretia" the first time, 
		you want it to still be "Lucretia" the second time), you can use 
		a variable to pick the word just once and then store it for use 
		later in the tweet. To store a variable, use this notation: 
		[variableName:#variableListName#] at the beginning of the "origin" 
		list (it will not show up in the output when you write it here). 
		Then, when you want to refer to that variable, use #variableName#.</br>
		</br>
		Example Code:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		{
		"origin":["[myName:#name#][myClass:#class#]My character #myName# is a #level# level #myClass#. #myClass.capitalize.s# are my favorite class to play as."],</br>
		"name":["Lucretia","Roswell","Davenport","Johann","Sloane","Hurley","Barry"],</br>
		"level":["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th","8th","9th","10th"],</br>
		"class":["cleric","fighter","wizard","rogue","bard","druid","paladin"],</br>
		"place":["Neverwinter","Phandalin","Rockport","the Moon","the Felicity Wilds"]</br>
		}
		</div></br>
		</br>
		Example Output:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		My character Barry is a 9th level cleric. Barry is from Rockport.
		</div></br>
		</br>
		STEP THREE: Modifiers</br>
		You may want to modify certain variables by capitalizing them, 
		putting "a" or "an" in front of them, or making them plural or past 
		tense. You can do that by adding modifiers to the variables; for 
		example, #name.capitalize# will pick a random item from the "name" 
		list and capitalize the first letter. You can also create your own 
		modifiers if you know Javascript, but that's beyond the scope of 
		this tutorial. Here are some built-in modifiers:</br>
		#variable.capitalize# (capitalizes first letter of variable)</br>
		#variable.capitalizeAll# (capitalizes all letters of variable)</br>
		#variable.a# (adds an "a" or "an" in front of variable)</br>
		#variable.s# (makes variable plural)</br>
		#variable.ed# (makes variable past tense)</br>
		</br>
		Note: Some of the modifiers may not work properly with words 
		that have irregular forms of the past tense/plural/etc.</br>
		</br>
		Example Code:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		{
		"origin":["[myName:#name#][myClass:#class#]My character #myName# is a #level# level #myClass#. #myClass.capitalize.s# are my favorite class to play as."],</br>
		"name":["Lucretia","Roswell","Davenport","Johann","Sloane","Hurley","Barry"],</br>
		"level":["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th","8th","9th","10th"],</br>
		"class":["cleric","fighter","wizard","rogue","bard","druid","paladin"],</br>
		"place":["Neverwinter","Phandalin","Rockport","the Moon","the Felicity Wilds"]</br>
		}
		</div></br>
		</br>
		Example Output:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		My character Johann is a 1st level bard. Bards are my favorite class to play as.
		</div></br>
		</br>
		STEP FOUR: Varying Your Structure</br>
		You may want your bot to tweet several variations on your subject. 
		For instance, in addition to "My character [name] is a [level] 
		level [class].", perhaps I also want my bot to be able to 
		generate a full party of characters, like this: "My party is made 
		up of a [class] named [name], a [class] named [name], 
		and a [class] named [name]." We can do that by creating a 
		list of structures for our bot to pick from, the same way we did 
		with lists of words. Think of it as a MadLib with other MadLibs 
		nested inside it.</br>
		</br>
		Example Code:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		{
		"origin":["#line#"],
		"line":["[myName:#name#][myClass:#class#]My character #myName# is a #level# level #myClass#. #myClass.capitalize.s# are my favorite class to play as.","My party is made up of a #class# named #name#, a #class# named #name#, and a #class# named #name#."],</br>
		"name":["Lucretia","Roswell","Davenport","Johann","Sloane","Hurley","Barry"],</br>
		"level":["1st","2nd","3rd","4th","5th","6th","7th","8th","9th","10th"],</br>
		"class":["cleric","fighter","wizard","rogue","bard","druid","paladin"],</br>
		"place":["Neverwinter","Phandalin","Rockport","the Moon","the Felicity Wilds"]</br>
		}
		</div></br>
		</br>
		Example Output:</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		My party is made up of a bard named Roswell, a wizard named Lucretia, and a wizard named Davenport.
		</div>
		or</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		My character Sloane is a 5th level cleric. Clerics are my favorite class to play as.
		</div></br>
		</br>
		If you've been able to follow the tutorial up to this 
		point, congrats! You've learned the basics of Tracery. 
		For many bots, you only need these tools plus a more expanded set 
		of word lists and structures. The lists I used were very short, 
		but you can put far more words in your list for more variety.</br>
		</br>
		STEP FIVE: Hosting Your Bot on CBDQ</br>
		First, <a href="https://twitter.ocm/i/flow/signup">create 
		a Twitter account</a> for your bot to tweet from.
		Then go to <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com">Cheap Bots Done Quick</a> 
		and log in with that same Twitter account. Copy and paste your 
		Tracery code into the box that says Tracery JSON, and set how often 
		you'd like your bot to tweet. Click save. Congratulations! 
		You've made a Twitter bot!</br>
		</br>
		If you're interested in looking into making Twitter bots 
		that go beyond what Tracery can do, I recommend visiting 
		<a href="https://botwiki.org/resources/twitterbots/">Botwiki</a>
		for a masterlist of bot resources and tutorials.</p>
		</br>
		(This is as far as we got in the original CS Club Twitter bots tutorial.
		Read on for new and exciting information!)</br>
		</br>
		<h4>Generating Images</h4>
		Not only can you generate text with Tracery, you can also create
		images! I'll show two different ways to go about doing this, but
		both of them use SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics). Here's a
		Tracery ruleset that generates an SVG with a red background and
		circles with randomly generated size, position, and color. (You'll
		have to delete the extra space in front of the "svg" and "circle"
		tags-- I had to insert those to get them to display here as text,
		but you don't want those spaces in the actual Tracery code.)</br>
		<div class="code-sample">
		{
"origin":["hello world{svg < svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\" style=\"background-color: red;\">#circles#</ svg>}"],
"circles":["#star2##star2##star2##star2##star2##star2#"],
"star2":["< circle fill='\\##color##color##color#' cx='#place#' cy='#place#' r='1#digit#'>< /circle>"],
"place":["#digit##digit#"],
"digit":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","0"],
"color":["00","11","22","33","44","55","66","77","88","99","AA","BB","CC","DD","EE","FF"]
}
		</div></br>
		The "hello world" would be the caption of the tweet, and the {svg} part would be the attached image. When working with images, it can sometimes be easier to just work with the CBDQ editor, since it displays the image a little more clearly.</br>
		</br>
		There's lots more you can do with SVGs and Tracery. Try looking at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_reference.asp">the W3Schools page</a> to find more attributes you can adjust.</br>
		</br>
		To close out this tutorial, I'll show you one more cool trick:
		importing pictures. Here's <a href="https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/source/cs_club_img_bot">
		a link</a> to the Tracery source code for my cat memes bot, as an example. (You should be able to copy and paste from there without
		the extra spaces issue.)
		And here's an example of the output image:</br>
		<img src="../images/cat_meme.png" alt="a brown and white cat, captioned 'a beautiful lady'"/></br>
		</br>
		I won't get into as much detail about this example, since you should be able to figure out what a lot of it means now that you're somewhat comfortable with Tracery syntax, but I'll note a few things here and explain further at the tutorial meeting:</br>
		-the xmlns:xlink stuff is necessary for linking to an image</br>
		-I imported a Google Font for the text on the image, using an @import statement</br>
		-I also linked to a bunch of cat pics that I uploaded to my account on the CSCI server, and Tracery randomly selects from those.</br>
		That's where we'll wrap up for this tutorial. Now you have all the basic skills to start making bots. There's many other tools out there if you want to get really advanced, and I encourage you to explore them!
